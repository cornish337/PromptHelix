# PromptHelix

A Python framework for AI prompt generation and optimization using a Prompt DNA System.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for developing, evolving, and managing
AI prompts through innovative techniques inspired by genetic algorithms and multi-agent systems.

## Features (Planned)

*   Genetic Algorithm for prompt optimization
*   Multi-agent system for collaborative prompt engineering
*   Integration with various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
*   Performance tracking and evaluation of prompts
*   API for programmatic access and integration
*   User interface for managing and experimenting with prompts
