        # making broadcast_ga_update calls, then the count should be 0 from this method.
        # The only broadcast call is from initialize_population or control methods.

        # Let's re-verify PopulationManager.evolve_population in engine.py.
        # It does NOT call self.broadcast_ga_update.
        # So, mock_broadcast.call_count should be 0 for calls made *by evolve_population*.

        # If the intention is to test broadcasts *within* evolve_population, then they need to be added there.
        # Given the current engine.py, evolve_population does not broadcast.

        # If the test is about broadcasts that HAPPEN around evolution (e.g. by runner),

        # then the count would be 1 (from __init__ if it called it).
        # The provided PopulationManager doesn't call broadcast in __init__.

        # Conclusion: This test, as written, expects broadcasts from evolve_population.
        # Since they are not there, it will fail if it expects calls.
        # Let's assume the test intended to check that NO broadcasts are made by evolve_population directly.
        # Or, if they *should* be made, this test highlights they are missing from engine.py.

        # For now, let's assert no calls from evolve_population itself.
        # If calls are made by initialize_population in setup, those would be separate.
        # This test setup does *not* call initialize_population. It manually sets manager.population.

        # Check calls made ONLY by the evolve_population call.
        # If mock_broadcast was fresh (e.g. self.mock_message_bus.reset_mock() before evolve call),

        # Since it's not reset, and __init__ doesn't call it, count should be 0 from this specific method.
