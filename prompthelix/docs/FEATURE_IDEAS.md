# PromptHelix Feature Ideas

This document outlines potential feature enhancements for the PromptHelix platform, based on an analysis of its current capabilities and architecture. For each feature, the core concept is described, followed by the main areas to concentrate on for successful implementation.

## Feature 1: Advanced Prompt Analytics and Visualization Dashboard

*   **Concept:**
    Provide users with a comprehensive dashboard to visualize prompt evolution, compare performance metrics across generations, analyze the impact of different "genes" (prompt components), and track LLM API usage and costs. This aims to make the prompt optimization process more transparent and data-driven.

*   **Main Things to Concentrate On:**
    1.  **Comprehensive Data Logging & Persistence:** Systematically capture and store detailed data on prompt lineage, versions, genetic operations, full evaluation results (not just fitness scores), LLM interaction details (tokens, cost, latency), and experiment configurations. This requires significant database schema design/extension.
    2.  **Efficient Data Querying & Aggregation:** Develop backend APIs to efficiently fetch and process this data for various analytical views (trends, comparisons, cost breakdowns).
    3.  **Frontend Development (Dashboard UI):** Create new UI pages with interactive charts and tables (e.g., fitness trends, cost analysis, prompt lineage trees) using a suitable visualization library.
    4.  **Defining Key Performance and Analytical Metrics:** Go beyond simple fitness to include metrics like prompt diversity, gene contribution scores (correlation of genes with success), and cost-effectiveness.

## Feature 2: Interactive Prompt "Gene" Editor & Manual Evolution Control

*   **Concept:**
    Allow users to directly manipulate the components ("genes") of prompts, manually craft new ones within the system's framework, and then evaluate these changes or inject them into the genetic algorithm. This combines human intuition with algorithmic optimization.

*   **Main Things to Concentrate On:**
    1.  **Granular and Editable Prompt Representation:** Define a clear structure for how prompts are broken down into editable "genes." This might involve enhancing the current string-based gene representation or moving to a more structured component system.
    2.  **Intuitive User Interface (UI) for Editing:** Develop a UI for visualizing and editing these genes (e.g., text fields, drag-and-drop reordering, add/delete gene buttons).
    3.  **Seamless Integration with GA & Agent System:** Create API endpoints and modify core logic to allow edited prompts to be evaluated by the `FitnessEvaluator`, used as seeds for new GA runs, injected into existing populations, or processed by specific agents (e.g., `StyleOptimizerAgent`) on demand.
    4.  **State Management & Versioning of Manual Edits:** Track manually edited prompts and ensure these interventions are logged, especially if they influence ongoing GA experiments.

## Feature 3: Collaborative Prompt Engineering & Version Control

*   **Concept:**
    Transform PromptHelix into a multi-user platform enabling teams to collaborate on prompt development. This includes features for sharing, robust version control for prompts and experiments (akin to "Git for Prompts"), and communication.

*   **Main Things to Concentrate On:**
    1.  **Robust User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement secure user accounts, login, and a permissions system to manage access to prompts and experiments.
    2.  **Designing a Versioning System:** Develop a system for tracking versions of prompts and their associated metadata (changes, authors, timestamps, performance at that version). This includes APIs for viewing history, diffing, and potentially reverting.
    3.  **Developing Collaboration-Specific Features & UI:** Implement functionalities like sharing prompts/experiments with other users/teams, a commenting system, and UI elements to support these interactions.
    4.  **Audit Trails and Traceability:** Log user actions related to prompt management and collaboration to ensure accountability and transparency in a team setting.
